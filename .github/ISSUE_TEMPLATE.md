Please note that this issue tracker is only used to discuss issues with the blog content, e.g.

- RSS feed is not working
- Some UI issue
- Some typos in some of the article
- etc...

For issues relating to other projects, please use the issue in the relevant repo, StackOverflow, MSDN Forum, ...

The reason I want to avoid having technical discussions here is that no one else will find them here, and I prefer having them is a real open forum.

Thanks for reading my blog!
